# Precise Movement Project
Project that contains two kinds of spawner and customizable targets for objects movement.

This is a basic spawner that uses `transform.localPosition` to move and directly uses  `Time.deltaTime` to calculate when to spawn and to go to the next target.
This spawner only works with the `Time.deltaTime` with no more calculation, so it doesn't work well when FPS changes.

This is a more elaborate spawner that also uses `transform.localPosition` for positioning, but it saves the time offset (when spawning and changing directions) to calculate a better precision for the objects.

## How it works

For example when you spawn an object with a rate of 20 objects per second (50 milliseconds per object) at 30 FPS or calling the Unity `Update` method each 34 ms, with the Basic Spawner an object should spawn each 68 ms or 2 frames at 30 FPS, but it wonâ€™t be accurate because the rate desired is 50 ms, there would be a 18 ms of difference in time, that increases each time an object is spawned.

Using the Precise Spawner, the objects are spawned in a similar way as the previous spawner but the time for spawn is saved in a `List<float> _timeoffset` that will save how much time has passed after a frame, and we can move the object to a more accurate position. The same logic is used when the object change directions to another target.
