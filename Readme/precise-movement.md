# Precise Movement Project
Project that contains two kinds of spawner and customizable targets for objects movement.

This is a basic spawner that uses `transform.localPosition` to move and directly uses  `Time.deltaTime` to calculate when to spawn and to go to the next target.
This spawner only works with the `Time.deltaTime` with no more calculation, so it doesn't work well when FPS changes.

This is a more elaborate spawner that also uses `transform.localPosition` for positioning, but it saves the time offset (when spawning and changing directions) to calculate a better precision for the objects.

## How it works

For example when you spawn an object with a rate of 20 objects per second (50 milliseconds per object) at 30 FPS or calling the Unity `Update` method each 34 ms, with the Basic Spawner an object should spawn each 68 ms or 2 frames at 30 FPS, but it wonâ€™t be accurate because the rate desired is 50 ms, there would be a 18 ms of difference in time, that increases each time an object is spawned.

Using the Precise Spawner, the objects are spawned in a similar way as the previous spawner but the time for spawn is saved in a `List<float> _timeoffset` that will save how much time has passed after a frame, and we can move the object to a more accurate position. The same logic is used when the object change directions to another target.

## How to use the project

The project is located in `Gameplay/Helper/PreciseMovement/PreciseMovement.unity`

When the scene is opened, you can play and test the project. The buttons **Basic Spawner** and **Precise Spawner** toggles between the Spawners system.

The buttons 15, 30 and 60 FPS change the Frames per second of the project, so you can check the performance of each spawner.

To set up the parameters of each spawner:

To set up the targets of each spawner, you can modify positions, add and remove targets. They are detected by the position order in their parent container.
